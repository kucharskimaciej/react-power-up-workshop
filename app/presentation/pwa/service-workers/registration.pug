                The following code should run as the application loads.
                Good place for it might be the very bottom of `index.html` file.

        +code_focus('1').current-only
            :markdown-it
                Only run the code in browsers that actually support service workers

        +code_focus('2').current-only
            :markdown-it
                After the app fully loaded...

        +code_focus('4').current-only
            :markdown-it
                ... register the service worker that is located in `public/service-worker.js`.

        +code_focus('5-9').current-only
            :markdown-it
                Log an error if there was a problem while registering the service worker
